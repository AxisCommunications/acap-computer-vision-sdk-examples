# How to use web server in ACAP version 4

This document explains briefly how to build and use the [Monkey web server](https://github.com/monkey/monkey) in ACAP version 4. Monkey is a fast and lightweight web server for Linux. It has been designed to be very scalable with low memory and CPU consumption, the perfect solution for Embedded Linux and high-end production environments. Besides the common features as HTTP server, it expose a flexible C API which aims to behave as a fully HTTP development framework, so it can be extended as desired through the plugins interface. The Monkey web server [documentation](http://monkey-project.com/documentation/1.5) describes the configuration in detail.

## Structure of this application

Below is the structure of the application with a brief description of its files.

```

## Requirements

Meet the following requirements to ensure compatibility with the example:

* Axis device
  * Chip: ARTPEC-{7-8} DLPU devices (e.g., Q1615 MkIII)
  * Firmware: 10.9 or higher
  * [Docker ACAP](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap) installed and started, using TLS and SD card as storage
* Computer
  * Either [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) version 4.11.1 or higher, or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) version 20.10.17 or higher with BuildKit enabled using Docker Compose version 1.29.2 or higher

## Limitations

* Apache Reverse Proxy can not translate content with absolute addresses (e.g. `/image.png`) in the HTML page. Use only relative content (e.g. `image.png` or `../image.png`). More information how to handle relative URLs correctly with a reverse proxy [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/561892/how-to-handle-relative-urls-correctly-with-a-reverse-proxy).

## Configure Apache to forward HTTP requests

The Axis camera's web server can be accessed from a web browser either directly using a port number (e.g. <http://mycamera:8080>) or through the Apache server in the camera using a route (e.g. <http://mycamera/monkey/>). To configure the Apache server as a reverse proxy server, use the procedure shown below.

```sh
# Do ssh login to the camera
ssh root@<CAMERA_IP>

# Add reverse proxy configuration to the Apache server, example:
cat >> /etc/apache2/httpd.conf <<EOF
ProxyPass /monkey/demo http://localhost:2001
ProxyPassReverse /monkey/demo http://localhost:2001
ProxyPass /monkey http://localhost:8080
ProxyPassReverse /monkey http://localhost:8080
EOF

# Restart the Apache server
systemctl restart httpd
```

## How to run the code

Start by building the Docker image containing the web server code with examples. This will compile the code to an executable and create a container containing the executable, which can be uploaded to and run on the camera. After the web server is started it can be accessed from a web browser by navigating to <http://mycamera/monkey/> or <http://mycamera:8080>.

### Export the environment variable for the architecture

Export the `ARCH` variable depending on the architecture of your camera:

```sh
# For arm32
export ARCH=armv7hf

# For arm64
export ARCH=aarch64
```

### Build the Docker image

With the architecture defined, the `monkey` image can be built. The environment variables are supplied as build arguments such that they are made available to docker during the build process:

```sh
# Define app name
export APP_NAME=monkey

# Install qemu emulator to build for different architectures
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --credential yes --persistent yes

# Build the container
docker build --tag $APP_NAME --build-arg ARCH .
```

### Set your device IP address and clear Docker memory

```sh
DEVICE_IP=<actual camera IP address>
DOCKER_PORT=2376

docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT system prune --all --force
```

If you encounter any TLS related issues, please see the TLS setup chapter regarding the `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable in the [Docker ACAP repository](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap).

### Install the image

Next, the built image needs to be uploaded to the device. This can be done through a registry or directly. In this case, the direct transfer is used by piping the compressed application directly to the device's docker client:

```sh
docker save $APP_NAME | docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT load
```

### Run the container

With the application image on the device, it can be started using `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
docker-compose --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT up

# Terminate with Ctrl-C and cleanup
docker-compose --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT down
```

### The expected output

Running the application on the camera should output information similar to what's shown below.

```text
Monkey HTTP Server v1.5.6
Built : Jun 18 2021 11:05:42 (arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -mthumb -mfpu=neon -mfloat-abi=hard -mcpu=cortex-a9 9.3.0)
Home  : http://monkey-project.com
[+] Process ID is 6
[+] Server socket listening on Port 2001
[+] 2 threads, 253 client connections per thread, total 506
[+] Transport layer by liana in http mode
[+] Linux Features: TCP_FASTOPEN SO_REUSEPORT
```

With the Monkey web server running, navigate to <http://mycamera:8080/> to see the served web page. If you managed to configure the Apache reverse proxy, the same page is also served at <http://mycamera/monkey/>.

## C API Examples

Some C API examples are included in the web server container that has been built. The commands below show how to run the examples on the camera. To see the result, use a web browser and navigate to <http://mycamera/monkey/demo/> or <http://mycamera:2001>.

```sh
# Run the hello example
docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT  run --rm --publish 2001:2001 -it $APP_NAME hello

# Run the list directory example
docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT  run --rm --publish 2001:2001 -it $APP_NAME list

# Run the quiz example
docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT  run --rm --publish 2001:2001 -it $APP_NAME quiz
```

## Proxy settings

Depending on the network, you might need proxy settings in the following file: `~/.docker/config.json`.
