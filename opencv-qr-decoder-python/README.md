## OpenCV QR Decoder

This example shows a minimal QR code detector and decoder application written in Python.
It involves using OpenCV to create a video stream, NumPy to preprocess
the images and OpenCV to detect and decode any QR codes within the image. The example uses the
[ACAP Computer Vision SDK](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk) to get
OpenCV with VDO integration, allowing capture of a video stream through OpenCV's standard
VideoCapture class. Additionally, Python, NumPy and OpenBLAS are also copied
from the Computer Vision SDK.

## Application layout

```text
opencv-qr-decoder-python
├── app
│   └── qr.py
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

* **qr.py**              - The application's main script
* **Dockerfile**         - Dockerfile specifying how the application runtime is built
* **docker-compose.yml** - docker-compose file specifying how/with what settings the application is started

## Requirements

Meet the following requirements to ensure compatibility with the example:

* Axis device
  * Chip: ARTPEC-{7-8} DLPU devices (e.g., Q1615 MkIII)
  * Firmware: 10.9 or higher
  * [Docker ACAP](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap) installed and started, using TLS and SD card as storage
* Computer
  * Either [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) version 4.11.1 or higher,
  * or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) version 20.10.17 or higher with BuildKit enabled using Docker Compose version 1.29.2 or higher

## How to run the code

### Export the environment variable for the architecture

Export the `ARCH` variable depending on the architecture of your camera:

```sh
# For arm32
export ARCH=armv7hf

# For arm64
export ARCH=aarch64
```

### Build the Docker image

With the architecture defined, the `acap-opencv-qr-decoder-python` image can be built. The environment variables are supplied as build arguments such that they are made available to docker during the build process:

```sh
# Define app name
export APP_NAME=acap-opencv-qr-decoder-python

docker build --tag $APP_NAME --build-arg ARCH .
```

### Set your device IP address and clear Docker memory

```sh
DEVICE_IP=<actual camera IP address>
DOCKER_PORT=2376

docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT system prune --all --force
```

If you encounter any TLS related issues, please see the TLS setup chapter regarding the `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable in the [Docker ACAP repository](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap).

### Install the image

Next, the built images needs to be uploaded to the device. This can be done through a registry or directly. In this case, the direct transfer is used by piping the compressed application directly to the device's docker client:

```sh
docker save $APP_NAME | docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT load
```

### Run the container

With the application image on the device, it can be started. As the example uses OpenCV, the OpenCV requirements will be included in `docker-compose.yml`, which is used to run the application:

```sh
docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT compose up

# Terminate with Ctrl-C and cleanup
docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT compose down --volumes
```
