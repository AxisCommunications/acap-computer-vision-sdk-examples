# A minimal, machine learning inference application

This example demonstrates how to create a simple Python application that performs inference on the camera image. This is done using the ACAP Computer Vision SDK.

The example largely consists of three parts: the Python script [simple_inference.py](simple_inference.py) that is run on device, the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) which build the application image and the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) which specifies how the inference server and client is connected as well as specify the required mounts and environment variables needed.

## Example structure

Following are the list of files and a brief description of each file in the example

```text
minimal-ml-inference
├── config
│   ├── env.aarch64
│   └── env.armv7hf
├── simple_inference.py
├── Dockerfile
├── Dockerfile.model
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

* **config/*** - Environment configuration files
* **simple_inference.py** - A Python script that captures an image and send an inference call to the model server
* **Dockerfile** - Build instructions for the application image that is run on the camera
* **Dockerfile.model** - Build instructions for the inference model
* **docker-compose.yml** - A docker-compose file that specifies how the application is run (mounts, environment variables, etc.,)

## Requirements

Meet the following requirements to ensure compatibility with the example:

* Axis device
  * Chip: ARTPEC-{7-8} DLPU devices (e.g., Q1615 MkIII)
  * Firmware: 10.9 or higher
  * [Docker ACAP](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap) installed and started, using TLS and SD card as storage
* Computer
  * Either [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) version 4.11.1 or higher, or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) version 20.10.17 or higher with BuildKit enabled using Docker Compose version 1.29.2 or higher

## How to run the code

### Export the environment variable for the architecture

Export the `ARCH` variable depending on the architecture of your camera:

```sh
# For arm32
export ARCH=armv7hf

# Valid options for chip on armv7hf are 'tpu' (hardware accelerator) or 'cpu'
export CHIP=tpu
```

```sh
# For arm64
export ARCH=aarch64

# Valid options for chip on aarch64 are 'artpec8' (hardware accelerator) or 'cpu'
export CHIP=artpec8
```

### Build the Docker images

With the architecture defined, the `acap4-minimal-ml-inference` and `acap-dl-models` images can be built. The environment variables are supplied as build arguments such that they are made available to docker during the build process:

```sh
# Define app name
export APP_NAME=acap4-minimal-ml-inference
export MODEL_NAME=acap-dl-models

# Install qemu to allow build flask for a different architecture
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --credential yes --persistent yes

# Build app
docker build --tag $APP_NAME --build-arg ARCH .

# Build inference model
docker build --file Dockerfile.model --tag $MODEL_NAME --build-arg ARCH .
```

### Set your device IP address and clear Docker memory

```sh
DEVICE_IP=<actual camera IP address>
DOCKER_PORT=2376

docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT system prune --all --force
```

If you encounter any TLS related issues, please see the TLS setup chapter regarding the `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable in the [Docker ACAP repository](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap).

### Install the images

Next, the built images needs to be uploaded to the device. This can be done through a registry or directly. In this case, the direct transfer is used by piping the compressed application directly to the device's docker client:

```sh
docker save $APP_NAME | docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT load

docker save $MODEL_NAME | docker --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT load
```

### Run the containers

With the application image on the device, it can be started using `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
docker-compose --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT --env-file ./config/env.$ARCH.$CHIP up

# Terminate with Ctrl-C and cleanup
docker-compose --tlsverify --host tcp://$DEVICE_IP:$DOCKER_PORT --env-file ./config/env.$ARCH.$CHIP down --volumes
```

The expected output from the application is the raw predictions from the model specified in the environment variable.

### Hardware acceleration

The `./config` folder contains configuration files with the parameters to run the inference on different camera models, also giving the possibility to use the hardware accelerator. To achieve the best performance we recommend using the TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) equipped with ARTPEC-7 cameras (e.g. [Axis-Q1615 Mk III](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1615-mk-iii)) or the DLPU (Deep Learning Processing Unit) equipped in ARTPEC-8 cameras (e.g. [Axis-Q1656](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q1656)).
